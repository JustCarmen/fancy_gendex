Fancy Gendex
====================

Fancy Gendex Module for webtrees.

This module requires [webtrees 1.7.0](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees) or later. Download the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_gendex/releases/latest).

Description
-----------
A GENDEX file is an index of personal data and a short page URL. It is used to index a genealogical website by a genealogical search engine. The idea behind it is to join numerous pedigrees of individual genealogical researchers to a central database, while the individual genealogical researchers are still keeping all control over their data. Unlike a GEDCOM file a GENDEX file contains no information about the family relationships between individuals. This means the file is useless without the corresponding website.

__The GENDEX file only contains public data.__

The search engines below are known to accept the GENDEX textfile created by this module:
* [The Gendex Network (English/International)](http://www.gendexnetwork.org)
* [Familytreeseeker (English/International)](http://www.familytreeseeker.com)
* [Stamboomzoeker (Dutch)](http:/www.stamboomzoeker.nl)

On the Fancy Gendex configuration page select the trees you want to include and push the button to create your GENDEX file.
