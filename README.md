Fancy Gendex
====================

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/JustCarmen/fancy_gendex.svg)][1]
[![webtrees major version](https://img.shields.io/badge/webtrees-v1.x-green)][2]

Fancy Gendex Module for webtrees. This is a webtrees 1 module. It cannot be used with webtrees 2.

Description
-----------
A GENDEX file is an index of personal data and a short page URL. It is used to index a genealogical website by a genealogical search engine. The idea behind it is to join numerous pedigrees of individual genealogical researchers to a central database, while the individual genealogical researchers are still keeping all control over their data. Unlike a GEDCOM file a GENDEX file contains no information about the family relationships between individuals. This means the file is useless without the corresponding website.

__The GENDEX file only contains public data.__

The search engines below are known to accept the GENDEX textfile created by this module:
* [The Gendex Network (English/International)][7]
* [Familytreeseeker (English/International)][8]
* [Stamboomzoeker (Dutch)][9]

On the Fancy Gendex configuration page select the trees you want to include and push the button to create your GENDEX file.
